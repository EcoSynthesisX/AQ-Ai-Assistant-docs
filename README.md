# Air Quality Smart Bot Technical Requirements and Descriptions

## Project Scope and Objectives
- Primary Goals: The primary goal is to raise awareness and educate the general public on air pollution topics.
- Scope: Initially, the pilot phase will focus on Koh Phangan, with plans to scale globally.
- Objectives: 
  - Provide real-time local air quality reports with recommendations based on US AQ standards and WHO recommendations.
  - Enable user interaction via chat, offering insights on environmental topics.
  - Address specific environmental issues on Koh Phangan, including local industrial and backyard garbage burning, and global background air pollution.

## User Interaction
- Platforms: The bot will be accessible on the web, Telegram, and other messaging platforms.
- User Engagement: Users will interact with the bot through notifications for significant air quality changes, on-demand inquiries, and within the EcoHarmony app.
- Chat Capabilities: Users will be able to obtain local-specific information on environmental protection events, local nonprofit activities, local recycling centers, and more.

## Air Quality Data Sources
- Data Source: Air quality data will be sourced from OpenWeather API, ensuring broad access to free data on compound levels.
- Data Update Frequency: The bot will provide real-time updates to ensure the latest air quality information is available.

## Features and Functionality
- Key Features:
  - Generating AQ reports.
  - Offering personalized recommendations based on air quality levels.
  - Providing expert advice on environmental topics.
  - Facilitating user chat interactions.
- Recommendations Algorithm: Recommendations will be based on current air pollution levels and relevance. This includes recommendations on masks and filters when appropriate.
- Contextual Information: The bot will mention local garbage burnings if signs are detected, especially during evening hours, and it will educate users about global (Asia) background pollution.

## Technology Stack
- Languages: The bot will be developed using Python and Langchain, with React and Node.js for deployment.
- Hardware: The solution is software-based, with no hardware components involved.

## User Experience (UX) Design
- Design Guidelines: The bot's interface will resemble the OpenAI ChatGPT design.
- Multimedia Support: While the bot can handle multimedia content, its primary function is text-based.

## Data Privacy and Security
- User Data Handling: No personal data will be stored or shared. User location will only be requested for air quality data retrieval.
- Data Transmission: Data transmission between the bot and the backend will be encrypted and secure.

## Testing and Deployment
- Testing Strategy: Extensive testing will cover functional, integration, UX, performance, security, compatibility, and usability aspects.
- Deployment Platforms: The bot will be deployed on Twitter, Telegram, and other messaging platforms.

## Monetization Strategy (if applicable)
- As of now, there are no monetization intentions for the bot.

## Timeline and Milestones
- Alpha and Beta Phases:
  - Beta 1 version expected in 2-3 months.
  - Beta 2 version planned within 2-3 weeks after Beta 1.

## Scalability
- The bot is designed to handle thousands of parallel requests, ensuring scalability to accommodate increasing user numbers.

## Maintenance and Support
- Regular maintenance and quality control will be performed weekly to ensure the bot's continued performance and user satisfaction.
